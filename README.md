Kaggle novice training competition. This is only for practice, it does not earn you Kaggle points.

To use the Kaggle API for command line visit the [docs](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api).

You can generate a fresh API token and copy it as a file called kaggle.json to ~/.kaggle/ on linux

The exploration, pre-processing,  and model building steps are explained in the R markdown file `Titanic_report_final.Rmd`
